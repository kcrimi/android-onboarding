# com.sillshare.Skillshare

This is the main bulk of the app. The file structure is not fully intuitive quite yet but the general gist is below. Plenty of room for improvement/clarity though!

- **application** - Fundamental/ app-wide things such as build configuration, implementation for dependency libraries and the application file itself
- **client** - View code, presenters, viewModels, etc
- **core_library** - The "backend" of the app. Local data storage, usecases, event bus events, etc
- **util** - Dark, dusty closet of random code intermixed with legitamate util classes
