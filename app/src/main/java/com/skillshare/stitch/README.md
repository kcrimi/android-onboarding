# Stitch

Stitch is a legacy in-house system made at Skillshare with the goal of serving view information via JSON rather than domain model data.

The goal was to create a flexible api which allowed backend developers to change screens on the native clients without needing to release new versions of native code.

The reality is that it is truly painful to work with, impossible to track down where code is called since much of that information is in API responses, and no one remains from the original team of creators to make those backend changes if we wanted.

Kill it

Kill it now!!!
